  'page-width'

* Fix doc indexation: last and first words of each lines weren't split
  correctly


2015/01/11 - 0.2.2:
* PDF + OCR: text wasn't indexed correctly

  label prediction accuracy was strongly reduced.
  Rebuilding your index is strongly recommended
  ("rm -rf ~/.local/share/paperwork" + restarting Paperwork)
