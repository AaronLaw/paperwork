# Paperwork installation on GNU/Linux Debian or GNU/Linux Ubuntu


## Package

Currently, there is no official Debian or Ubuntu package for Paperwork.


## Build dependencies

    $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-dev python3-pil

    # PyEnchant dependency
    $ sudo apt-get install libenchant-dev


## System-wide installation

You can then install paperwork using pip:

    $ sudo pip3 install paperwork

Some dependencies cannot be installed automatically, because they depend on
your language. You can find all the required dependencies not yet installed by
running 'paperwork-chkdeps'

    $ paperwork-shell chkdeps paperwork_backend
    $ paperwork-shell chkdeps paperwork


## Install through packages generated by python-stdeb

If you're reluctant to install system wide python libraries through pip, you can also use debian packages generated on the fly by [python-stdeb](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb) (install build dependencies above first):

    $ sudo apt-get install python3-stdeb
    $ sudo pypi-install pyocr
    $ sudo pypi-install pyinsane
    $ sudo pypi-install paperwork


## Running Paperwork

A shortcut should be available in the menus of your window manager (you may
have to log out first).

You can also start Paperwork by running the command 'paperwork'.

Enjoy :-)
