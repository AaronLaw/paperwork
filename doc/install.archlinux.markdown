# Paperwork installation on GNU/Linux ArchLinux


## Package

A package is available in [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/paperwork/).

If there is a problem with the package, please report it on
[the mailing-list](https://github.com/jflesch/paperwork/wiki/Contact#mailing-list).
Please do **not** report issue with packages on Paperwork's bugtracker. It is
**not** possible to assign issues to package maintainer on the bugtracker.


## Manual installation

See the [Fedora](install.fedora) or [Debian](install.debian) installation
guides for reference.

Please note that there is a key difference between ArchLinux and other
distributions: It's using Python 3.x by default instead of Python 2.7.
So you must replace the following commands:

* pip / python-pip --> pip2.7
* python --> python2.7


## Running Paperwork

A shortcut should be available in the menus of your window manager (you may
have to log out first).

You can also start Paperwork by running the command 'paperwork'.

Enjoy :-)
