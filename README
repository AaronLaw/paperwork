	IV) Development

If you want to make changes, here are few things that can help you:

1) You don't need to install paperwork to run it. Just run 'src/paperwork.py'.
2) Paperwork looks for a 'paperwork.conf' in the current work directory before
   looking for a '.paperwork.conf' in your home directory. So if you want to
   use a different config and/or a different set of documents for development
   than for your real-life work, just copy your '~/.paperwork.conf' to
   './paperwork.conf'. Note that the settings dialog will also take care of
   updating './paperwork.conf' instead of '~/.paperwork.conf'.
